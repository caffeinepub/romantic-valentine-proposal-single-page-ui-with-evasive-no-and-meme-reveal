  "summary": "Implemented frontend-only clean share link generation/copying (removes all URL hash content), added a reusable “Copy Share Link” button with a brief confirmation message, and added an admin-link notice that appears when the URL hash contains “caffeineAdminToken”. Overlay placement in RomanticSceneLayout uses pointer-events settings intended to avoid interfering with tap interactions. However, the diff does not confirm that these controls are surfaced on all required main screens (PasswordGate, proposal, YesTapSequence).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-28",
      "requirement": "Surface the “Copy Share Link” action in a clearly accessible place on all main app screens (PasswordGate view, proposal view, and YesTapSequence view) without interfering with existing tap-to-advance interactions.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the controls were added to RomanticSceneLayout, but there is no evidence in the provided diff summary that PasswordGate, proposal view, and YesTapSequence actually render within RomanticSceneLayout (or otherwise include the action) on all those screens.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/RomanticSceneLayout.tsx",
